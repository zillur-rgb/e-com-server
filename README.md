### Built with


- JavaScript
- Reactjs
- Context API
- Nodejs
- Expressjs
- Mongoose
- JSON Web Token
- Bcrypt
- Braintree Payment
- Bootstrap 5
- CSS 3


### What I Explored


- It was cool working with Braintree payment, it is a gret way to implement paypal and card in a same payment model.
- There are some states that needed to be maintained. I went with the Context API. The app is not that complex and I think no state management libraries are required for this project.


### Continued development


I will implement the user management section for admin. And also, I can make a lot of things reusable. Beside, I am thinking of using React-hook-form for form management. Paypal is also not working properly because I did not add my developer account.
